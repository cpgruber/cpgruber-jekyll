        "shortDesc": "I was pretty excited to get engaged. Not only because I get to marry my best friend, but also because I get to make the wedding website of my dreams. I wanted it to function as a guest book of sorts, allowing friends and family to send their well wishes, and what's a better way to convey a message than a gif. The site is integrated with the Giphy API and a Cloudant-hosted Couch database, which acts as a repository for our guests' gif-laden messages and feeds our channel lineup on the tv. Click the tv to open the form, and give it a shot (If I don't know you, please keep it clean). Still a work in progress, but the site is mostly finished and will be populated with real text and images later-- planning a wedding is a lot of work.",

        "shortDesc":"To quickly gauge a room's understanding of a topic, my instructors at General Assembly would often employ a fist-of-five method. Everyone in the class raises their hand to show their comfort level with a topic-- from a fist, representing complete despair, incrementing to five fingers, representing complete mastery. It can certainly be uncomfortable to hold up a fist when your neighbor is waving their hand in the air wanting to move on to the next lesson. Using web sockets, I emulated this fist-of-five method digitally, so the class can be gauged in the same way, the only difference being anonymity. The application generates unique links for polls, which are to be taken in real time, and displays results using a single hand to represent the class.",

The purpose of the visualization was to show how basketball's offensive efficiency metric is favorable to big-men over guards because of the weight of offensive rebounds in the calculation. The user is able to toggle between the components of the metric to compare the relative weights of each statistic, and see the skew of the metric toward players that crash the boards. Two players, Stephen Curry and Deandre Jordan, are highlighted throughout to show that even the league's most prolific scorer is deemed substantially less efficient than the one of the league's top rebounders.",

The front-end gets game data for a given day and graphically displays each box score.

I thought it would be cool to treat the playing cards as discrete data entities, rather than items in an array. I used D3 to bind data to individual cards, and CSS transitions to move them around the page as a part of the gameplay. I also made a simple data visualization to display the score and the number of plays that have been made.

I have some down time, and I know some D3,\" so I decided to enter the contest. I didn't think I'd win, especially being so new to the field of data visualization. Admittedly not a baseball fanatic, I did not know which stats to convey or what makes one player better than another. Since I had no preconception of who's best, I figured the most objective way to a visualize the players' careers is to put all the data in a forum where users can interact with it and infer what they want. I focused on user experience, and sought to provide the user a tool they could explore for a matter of minutes or hours. In the end, I made a series of line charts depicting seasonal or cumulative stats for each player, with a feature that allows users to compare players (for instance, Albert Pujols and Babe Ruth) for a particular statistic.",

The whole of Cape Cod was divided into a grid of hexagons (so hot right now, hexagons) and each hex was given a score for various characteristics based on what they intersect on the ground-- a better explanation is provided in the app itself. This project was handed to me in the form template-generated ESRI web app. Aesthetically, the app looked fine, but it lacked the interaction with the geographic data that my team sought. I decided to divorce the data from the template and build an app from scratch. My approach was to link the data displayed on the map to the section opened in the side panel, so that the user changes the map as they navigate through the narrative. To compare towns or areas, I came up with the three discs in the side panel, which the user can drag onto the map. When a disc is dragged, the characteristic score of the hexagons beneath this disc is averaged and displayed in a chart to provide a means for comparing towns and areas.",
