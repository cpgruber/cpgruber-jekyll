  <h2>Hi, I'm Chase.</h2>
  <p>I am a web developer, award-winning data vizzer, and a map nerd.</p>
  <p>Since moving to Washington, D.C. in 2015 to pursue a career in software development, I have been working at the intersection of technology and international development at Management Systems International. Before that, I was a Cape Cod washashore for a year and a half, where I made both paper and web-based maps for the county government (and also raked oysters as a side-hustle). <em>Aaaaand</em> before that, I was a student at Davidson College and Duke University, where I got my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, respectively.</p>
  <p>My current hobbies include trying (and failing) to keep up with the latest and greatest of web technologies, making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub_(drink)" target="_blank">shrubs</a> with my fianc√©e, and playing fetch with my cats, <a href="https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/13707393_281321048926684_2105038691_n.jpg" target="_blank">Gabe and Bear</a> (no shame).</p>
