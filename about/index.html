  <h2>Hi, I'm Chase.</h2>
  <p>I am a web developer, award-winning data visualizer, and a map nerd.</p>
  <p>I've been meaning to write my full autobiography, but I've been preoccupied with a few things: most recently, being immersed in code at General Assembly, working on (and winning) data visualization contests, and getting lost in my new city, Washington, D.C.</p>

  <p>Check back here for more information-- I will hope to have written something more meaningful over the holidays. If you have any pressing questions, feel free to contact me using one of the means below.</p>
